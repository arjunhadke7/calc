runApp takes the app class

runApp can take the Material app with home inside it

the Material App can be added to runApp as an arg directly without using the class
material app does not need the use of scaffold
without scaffold it will take the entire screen and show text in red with yellow underlines

then if we proceed with material app being passed to myapp

we can add Homescreen to the home: parameter


Homescreen can have the scaffold


you cannot use scaffold directly, scaffold needs to be used from material app
